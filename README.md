# airsim-vroom

This repository was created overnight to test the Airsim API, and train a car to find and navigate to an object using Reinforcement Learning.

## Dependencies / Testing
1. Install the amended Blocks environment (request if needed)
2. Build + compile shaders in the Blocks environment through UE4
3. Install requirements on requirements.txt
4. Start environment on UE4
5. Run training through main.py

## Planned Updates
- Testing of different RL algorithms
- Continuous control of car (vs. current discrete control)
- More explorations with Airsim to ascertain feasibility in training RL
